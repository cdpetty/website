      <center><a class='disclaimer_tag'>&lt;Disclaimer&gt;</a></center> I have this problem.  Its a small problem with a big impact. I just can't seem to finish projects. I've started dozens of projects in the past, and no matter how far I get, I seem to loose interest somewhere towards the end. As a result, some (most) of my projects are lacking a real shine. I apologize in advance. <center><a class='disclaimer_tag'>&lt;/Disclaimer&gt;</a></center>
