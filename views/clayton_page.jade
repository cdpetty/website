          I've been involved with music in some way, shape, or form since I was in Kindergarden. 
          After 6 years of piano lessons, I began to pick up the drums. In high school I joined the drumline as a snare player.  
          While participating in the drumline, I began to learn guitar in my spare time. Music has always been a part of my life, 
          and I have no doubt that it will stay that way in the future.

          After taking an AP Computer Science course my junior year of high school, I fell in love with Computer Science. 
          I have spent countless hours of my time working on side projects, learning new programming 
          languages, and in particular, web development. At Texas A&M, I am majoring in computer science and I absolutely love it.

        .clayton_topic_body.
          I love playing sports, not matter when or where. I recently broke my wrist playing basketball, and the 
          only thing I can think about is getting back on the court. I love football, soccer, volleyball, and pretty much anything that 
          doesnt involve running around a track.

          On August 22, 2013, I became an Eagle Scout. Throughout my entire life I have been an avid camper 
          and boy scout.  I enjoy getting to spend time outdoors with my best friends.  From 10 day canoe trips in Canada to 12 day hikes through New Mexico, I 
          have pretty much done it all.
