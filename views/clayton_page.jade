//-         .clayton_topic_body I've been involved with music in some way, shape, or form since I was in Kindergarden.  After 6 years of piano lessons, I began to pick up the drums. In high school I joined my school's drumline as a snare player.  My junior year, I competed in the national snare solo competition, PASIC, where I composed and performed my own solo. While participating in the drumline, I began to pickup guitar in my spare time.  However, I am still, by no means, an expert today. Music has always been a part of my life, and I have no doubt that it will stay that way in the future.

//-         .clayton_topic_body After taking the AP Computer Science class my junior year of high schoo, I feel in love with Computer Science. From that point on, I have spent countless hours of my time working on silly to serious side projects, learning new programming languages, and understanding more complicated data structures and algorithms. Today, I spend most of my time working on various personal web development projects.  If you are interested, you can find a copy of my resume <a href="/resume">here</a>.

//-         .clayton_topic_body I love playing sports, not matter when or where. I recently broke my wrist playing basketball, and the only thing I can think about is getting back on the court. I love football, soccer, volleyball, and pretty much anything that doesnt involve running around a track.

          After taking an AP Computer Science course my junior year of high school, I fell in love with Computer Science. 
          I have spent countless hours of my time working on side projects, learning new programming 
          languages, and in particular, web development. At Texas A&M, I am majoring in computer science and I absolutely love it.

          On August 22, 2013, I became an Eagle Scout. Throughout my entire life I have been a avid camper 
          and boy scout.  I enjoy getting to spend time outdoors with my best friends.  From 10 day canoe trips in Canada to 12 day hikes through New Mexico, I 
          have pretty much done it all.
