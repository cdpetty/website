        .clayton_topic_title Music
        .clayton_topic_body I've been involved with music in some way, shape, or form since I was in Kindergarden.  After 6 years of piano lessons, I began to pick up the drums. In high school I joined my school's drumline as a snare player.  My junior year, I competed in a national snare solo competition, PASIC, where I composed and performed my own solo. While participating in the drumline, I began to pickup guitar in my spare time.  However, I am still, by no means, an expert today. Music has always been a part of my life, and I have no doubt that it will stay that way in the future.

        .clayton_topic_title Programming
        .clayton_topic_body After taking the AP Computer Science class my junior year of high schoo, I feel in love with Computer Science. From that point on, I have spent countless hours of my time working on silly to serious side projects, learning new programming languages, and understanding more complicated data structures and algorithms. Today, I spend most of my time working on various personal web development projects.  If you are interested, you can find a copy of my resume <a href="/resume">here</a>.

        .clayton_topic_title Sports
        .clayton_topic_body I love playing sports, not matter when or where. I recently broke my wrist playing basketball, and the only thing I can think about is getting back on the court. I love football, soccer, volleyball, and pretty much anything that doesnt involve running around a track.

        .clayton_topic_title Camping
        .clayton_topic_body As of August, 22, 2013, I am an Eagle Scout. Throughout my entire life I have been a avid camper and boy scout.  I love being outdoors and hanging with some of my best friends.  From shotgun to mountain biking campouts, I have pretty much done it all.
