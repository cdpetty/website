About:
  This website was my 2014 summer project before college. I created this website to host a blog for myself, showcase some of my projects, and serve as a hub for "Clayton Petty" related activity.  The backend is written in javascript, using node.js and express.js. I used Jade, written by this guy, as my html templating engine. I wanted a clean, simple look, so as you will notice (hopefully), nothing appears overly complicated. I am often baffled at how beautiful websites can look these days, but am stunned at how ridiculously complicated they are to use. Especially websites that override the scrolling function and force you to awkwardly move from one section of the webpage to the next. Those really bug me. Blue is one of my favorite colors, so as you can see, it can be found in abundance throughout the website. I appreciate any input into the website! Comments and suggestions are welcome.
